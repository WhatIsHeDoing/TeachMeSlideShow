# Teach Me SlideShow

Learning through fun, interactive slideshows!

## Instructions

Simply run ``npm install ; npm run gulp`` to fire up the slideshow within your default browser.

Any changes you make to the slideshow within the HTML and JavaScript files will automagically reload
the browser, so please play with it and start making your own slideshows :)

Don't have ``npm`` available? Then simply install it via:

* Website: [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) for Windows: ``choco install node.js``
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) Linux: ``dnf install node.js``
